# UML

## Sequence 1

```puml
@startuml
Hans -> John : Hallo
John -> Carla : Hi
Carla -> Hans : Ola
@enduml
```

## Sequence 2

```puml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml
```

## Use Case 1

```puml
@startuml
:Main Admin: as Admin
(Use the application) as (Use)

User -> (Start)
User --> (Use)

Admin ---> (Use)

note right of Admin : This is an example.

note right of (Use)
  A note can also
  be on several lines
end note

note "This note is connected\nto several objects." as N2
(Start) .. N2

  fork again
    :Treatment 2;
  end fork

state "Not Shooting State" as NotShooting {
  state "Idle mode" as Idle
  state "Configuring mode" as Configuring
  [*] --> Idle
  Idle --> Configuring : EvConfig
  Configuring --> Idle : EvConfig
}

note right of NotShooting : This is a note on a composite state
